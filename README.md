This repository contains:
4 datafiles:
- CoastalMarshes_GPP.csv
These data were collected by Drs. Thomas Huff & Russell Faegin.  They are 16-day interval measurements of gross primary productivity  (GPP) for 3 coastal marshes (sites in Texas, Lousiana, and New Jersey) from 2000-2018.  GPP numbers are in moles C per square meter per day.  Direct inquiries about these data to Dr. Thomas Huff (thuff621@gmail.com).

- Fushan_WS4_monthlyNO3.csv
This file contains monthly stream nitrate measurements (in micrograms N per liter) from an experimental watershed in Fushan, Taiwan.  These data are also located at: github.com/geoadam/FH_Stream-Nitrate.   Data were collected by Dr. Teng-Chiu Lin (tengchiulin@outlook.com). 

- LUQ_QSmonthlyNO3.csv
This file contains monthly stream nitrate measurements (in micrograms N per liter) from the Quebrada Sonadora in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico.  These data belong to the Luquillo CZO (collected by Dr. Bill McDowell: bill.mcdowell@unh.edu) and should be crosschecked to EDI at: https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/f9df56348f510da0113b1e6012fa2967 (for metadata and the most current file versions). 

- TEXAS_BagSieneFishData.csv
Lastly, this file contains fish abundance data from seine catch surveys in four Texas coastal estuaries for the year of 2017, when Hurricane Harvey occurred.  For the historical data from 2000-2016 or other inquiries consult Dr. Chris Patrick (christopher.patrick@tamucc.edu).
